mtgo_to_decked.py
==============

This is a python script to convert MTGO v4 .csv files to Decked Builder .coll files.  All credit goes to Adrian Petrescu ([apetresc] (https://github.com/apetresc)) who wrote the original script found [here.](https://gist.github.com/apetresc/9fcc264886a9e051e695)

I updated it for the new sets released since the script was written, and updated some of the abbreviations to the new naming convention MTGO uses in v4.
